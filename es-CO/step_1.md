You can use Scratch online or offline.

+ To create a new Scratch project using the online editor, go to <a href="http://jumpto.cc/scratch-new" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/scratch-new</a>.

+ If you prefer to work offline and have not installed the editor yet, you can download it from <a href="http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/scratch-off</a>.
    
    The Scratch editor looks like this:

+ The cat sprite that you can see is the Scratch mascot. If you need an empty Scratch project, you can delete the cat by right-clicking it and then clicking **delete**.
